"""Write a program that uses print statements to print the following recipe into the Output console. The text to print is already there, you just need to make it into code. Your code should print all five lines exactly the same as the example output below."""

print("")

# print("She said: "Hello" and then left.")
# this produces an error message so either we use combination of the single and double quotes or we use \ \ like below examples
print('She said: "Hello" and then left.')
print("She said: \"Hello\" and then left.")
